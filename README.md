# Smart City Waste Management System

## About Me
I am **Shreyas Kurane**, a 2nd-year, 3rd-semester engineering student specializing in CS-AI. This repository is dedicated to my Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) project titled **Smart Waste Segregation System**, which aims to address waste management challenges in urban areas using advanced algorithms and data structures.

## Project Description
The "Smart City Waste Management System" encompasses a range of solutions for efficient waste management. Below are the modules and their details:

### 1. Smart Waste Segregation System
- **Description**: Categorizes waste based on type (organic, plastic, metal, paper) and generates structured reports on collected waste volumes.
- **Algorithm Involvement**:
  - **Sorting**: Merge Sort or Quick Sort for efficient sorting by properties (e.g., weight, size).
  - **Searching**: Binary Search for quick lookup of waste types.
- **Data Structures**:
  - **HashMap**: Maps waste items to categories (e.g., "Plastic" -> [bottle, bag]).
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Facilitates efficient classification.
- **Users**:
  - System Administrator: Manages the waste type database.
  - User: Inputs data for categorization.
- **Output**: Categorized waste reports, statistics, and disposal suggestions.

### 2. Waste Disposal and Recycling Recommendation System
- **Description**: Recommends disposal/recycling methods based on waste type and material.
- **Algorithm Involvement**:
  - **Searching**: Linear Search or Hash Table Search for retrieval.
- **Data Structures**:
  - **HashMap**: Maps disposal methods to waste types.
  - **Linked List**: Dynamic list of recyclable items.
- **Users**:
  - Households: Input waste details.
  - Recycling Centers: Update accepted recyclable materials.
- **Output**: Recommendations for disposal and nearby recycling centers.

### 3. Waste Volume Prediction System
- **Description**: Predicts future waste volumes based on historical data.
- **Algorithm Involvement**:
  - **Sorting**: Bucket Sort for organizing historical data.
- **Data Structures**:
  - **Array**: Stores historical data.
  - **Trie**: Manages location-based predictive data.
- **Users**:
  - City Planners: Allocate resources efficiently.
  - Citizens: Adjust waste disposal practices.
- **Output**: Forecast reports of waste trends.

### 4. Smart Bin Monitoring System
- **Description**: Monitors smart bins and alerts users when bins are full.
- **Algorithm Involvement**:
  - **Graph Traversal**: BFS or DFS for city-wide monitoring.
  - **Sorting**: Insertion Sort for organizing bin data.
- **Data Structures**:
  - **Graph**: Represents bin locations.
  - **Queue**: Manages monitoring requests.
- **Users**:
  - City Waste Department: Schedules pickups.
  - Households: Receives alerts.
- **Output**: Bin alerts and collection recommendations.

### 5. E-Waste Management System
- **Description**: Assists in categorizing and recycling e-waste.
- **Algorithm Involvement**:
  - **Hash Table with Quadratic Probing**: Resolves collisions in item lookup.
- **Data Structures**:
  - **Hash Table**: Maps e-waste items to disposal instructions.
- **Users**:
  - Consumers: Input e-waste details.
  - Recycling Centers: Update accepted items.
- **Output**: Recommendations for e-waste disposal.
